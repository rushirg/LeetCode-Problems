# Method 1
"""
We need not care about key âˆ’ 1, because if key is present in the harmonic subsequence, at one time either key + 1 or key - 1 only could be included in the harmonic subsequence.

# Method 2
"""
one loop with out Counter object
We consider both the key - 1 and key + 1 in this case because it could be possible that key has already been added to the map and later on key - 1 is encountered, this would result in wrong output
